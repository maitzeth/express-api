# Introduction

This is simple Express API Rest featuring some of basic routes, middleware, and JWT.

I just wanted to refresh my understanding of Backend Technologies after a long time away from it. 

So I decided to create this project as an exercise for myself

# Installation
```shell
  npm install
  # or
  yarn install
```

# Development
```shell
npm dev
  # or
yarn dev
```

# Used Technologies

```
- Expressjs: As a Backend "Framework"
- bcrypt: just to encrypt and decrypt password
- zod: As a schema declaration and validation library
- winston and morgan: To handle better logging.
- passport-jwt: To handle JWT session.
- mongoose: ORM for MongoDB
```
